# COVID-19-Vaccines-Red-vs.-Blue-States

In this project I analyzed COVID-19 vaccination rates along with state political party affiliations to determine if there is a statistical difference in mean vaccination rates among Democratic and Republican states. While I predicted
that Democratic states would have statistically higher vaccination rates on average, I found that the observed difference in means was not statistically significant at any legitimate significance level using an A/B permutation test. The results highlight how I often allow media to sway my own judgements when it comes to political ideaology.

## Research Question
Is there a present-day, significant difference in the percentage of citizens vaccinated against COVID-19 among Democratic and Republican states in the U.S.?

## Background & Prior Work

On January 20, 2020 the United States reported its first case of the novel coronavirus in Washington state. Following this, the country - and world -  entered a state of chaos and upheaval, attempting to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus. At the end of January 2020, the coronavirus outbreak was officially declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization. To date, there have been over six million COVID-19 related deaths worldwide, over one million of which belonging to the United States. Vaccinations against COVID-19 began rolling out in early 2021 and by March of that year more than one hundred million vaccinations had been administered in the U.S.. 

Amidst the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic the media portrayed Republican political leaders, such as Donald Trump, downplaying the deadly virus and mocking safety guidelines set by medical professionals. The media I took in at the time, highlighted these actions almost as much as the effects of the pandemic itself. As the COVID-19 vaccination became widely available to the public in the United States in early 2021, I also heard about the display of hesitancy by certain populations to receive the vaccine. The news depicted the populations that displayed hesitancy to be those with strong religious beliefs and those that like to hold on to their personal freedoms. In my mind, and likely the minds of many others, these population characteristics fell deeply in-line with those of right-wing America.

##  Hypothesis

After witnessing a lack of Republican leaders taking the COVID-19 pandemic seriously and reading about right-wing activists opposing vaccine mandates, I hypothesized that there would be a significant present-day difference in the vaccination rates administered between Republican and Democratic states in the U.S.. I predicted that Democratic affiliated states would have higher vaccination percentages on average than Republican affiliated states. I tested this hypothesis by carrying out exploratory data analysis and conducting an A/B permutation test using difference in means as the test statistic. I picked this hypothesis to identify any possible disparities in vaccination rates between states in America, allowing me to see where more people are vaccinated and less people are vaccinated.
